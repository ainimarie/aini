# About

Hello, I'm Aini and sometimes I'm awake for way too long.

I like cats and get hyperfixated in various (usually the same) things for x amount of time.

I've never been much of a writer, I get lost in my thoughts and get distracted by whatever else is happening in the next room. I mostly started this because I got sucked in the indie web and I miss the random internet of old times. I might also try to exercise my brain and that long lost concentration.

I am not really a social media person but sometimes I'm social enough
